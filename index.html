                    The length of a video is represented with a white bar filling up at the top of the video, which consistently communicates the length of the video and how far through the video the user is. 
                    This prevents confusion about how long it will take to watch a video to the end, and enables the viewer to make informed decisions of what they miss when clicking out of the video.

               </h3>

               <p class="paragraph">
                Upon clicking on the inbox feature, Pinterest does not explicitly communicate when their friend list is empty. Pinterest only offers Accounts under “suggested,” which may imply to some users that they need to add friends first. 
                However, new users who have not yet added any friends may benefit from being explicitly informed about the fact that the friend list is empty, since that system status is not intuitively apparent. <br> <br>

                <h3>
                    Strength
                </h3>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pinterest employs a comprehensive icon design for its inbox: The speech bubble. 
                    Originally stemming from comics, speech bubbles are a simple and effective way of denoting user-to-user communication.    
                </p>

                    Weakness
               </h3>

               <p class="paragraph">
                The Microcopy of the “Home” section does not match its content as clearly as it could. “Home” could be read as the user profile i.e., the metaphorical “home” of the user on the website. 
                Instead, it is used for the main content feed. <br> <br>

                <h3>
                    Strength
                </h3>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pinterest allows for a very high level of freedom for curating the content of the main feed. Users can remove any content they interacted with from the algorithm that generates the home feed content. 
                    This includes previously added topics, pin boards, saved pins, and even pins that the user had clicked on during the session.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    A classic example of a quick and effective workflow that Pinterest shares with other systems is the drag and drop function for uploading pins from the user’s hard drive. 
                    As a result, users that are used to this function can intuitively work with how it is implemented in the website.
